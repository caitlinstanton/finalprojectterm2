<h1>Caitlin and Michael's Final Project</h1>
Period 1
Michael Mattson and Caitlin Stanton

<h2>What our product does:</h2>
This is StuyGrades, an electronic gradebook. It allows users to add or find teachers, courses, or students in a neat and efficient manner. All the user has to do is type in the parameters and press enter.

<h2>How to run it</h2>
As this program was written entirely in Java, all you have to do is run the file named Driver.java. In order to interact with the program, the user needs to type in the parameters indicated by the prompts, which will ask for information such as the name of a teacher or the grade a student is receiving.
You can add a new teacher, a new course for a teacher, a new student in a course, or a new grade for a student. After running any of these methods, the updated list of teachers, courses, and students, respectively, will appear.
You also have the option to find a teacher, course, or student, which wil output the list of courses, students, and grades respectively.
