Aim: C what I did there?

Do Now:

   From yesterday:
   	4) Figure out what gcc does
	5) Copy woohoo.c from your home directory to a /code/
	   directory on homer (assume you are not working on
	   homer itself)

Today:
	
	List the java primitive variable types


- To move a file: mv file-directory new-file-directory
- To remove a file: rm file
- To remove all of a file: rm * .whatev
- To connect remotely: ssh username@other-place
- To find out what a command does: man command-name
- To move file from a computer to another server:
     scp source destination
     i.e. scp woohoo.c caitlin.stanton@homer.stuy.edu:/code/
     - destination-->other-place:remote-directory
       - if nothing after :, file will go to home directory


- Prompt: username@computer:~[directory]$
- pwd: shows present working directory


Last Class Today!
     
     - Someone will be chosen each day to recap the previous day's class on Piazza
     - Tag the note as "last class today"
     - Title the note: LCT <MM/DD WEEKDAY>
     	   - The day must eb the day you are posting notes from
     - Include an interesting piece of tech/science news at the end, with a link
     - Share the notes with just your class group
     - Will be graded as a HW assignment
     - Don't post late or points will be subtracted


Primitive Variable Types in Java:
     
     - boolean: true/false
     - char: single character
     - int: 32-bit integer
     - long: 64-bit integer with a longer range
     - double: 64-bit floating point number
     - float: 32-bit floating point number
     - byte: 8-bit integer
     - short: 16-bit integer


C Programming Language
     - Kernihan/Richie
     - Only integer/flaoting point primitives
       	    - No boolean
	    - char is more connected to its integer value
