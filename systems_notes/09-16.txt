Aim: Variables are the spice of life

Do Now: What is the smallest variable type that could be used to store the
   	following values (using standard sizes).
	1) 5
	   + byte
	2) -30,000
	   + short
	3) 255
	   + short
	4) 5,000,000,000
	   + long
	  
	  - byte:  8 bits; from (-2)^7 to (2^7)--1 [-128 to 127]
	  - short: 16 bits; from (-2)^14 to (2^15)--1 
	  - int: 32 bits; from (-2)^31 to (2^31)--1 [-2 billion to 2 billion]
	  - long: 64 bits; from (-2)^63 to (2^31)--1 [-9 billion to 9 billion]


C Primitive Variable Types

    - All C primitives are numeric
    - The only difference is floating point vs. integer and the size of the 
      variable
    - Size of variables may be platform dependent
      	   sizeof(<TYPE>) can be used to find the size in bytes
	   		  - i.e. sizeof(int)
    - TYPE		  STANDARD SIZE (in bytes)
      int		  	   4
      short			   2
      long			   8
      float			   4
      double			   8
      char			   1	--> in Java, it's 2 bytes
      				   	--> essentially the byte variable
      NO BOOLEAN VARIABLE    
      	 - All boolean values are numbers
	       0 --> false
	       anything BESIDES 0 --> true

    - YOU WILL ALL MAKE THIS MISTAKE:
      	  if (x = 6) {...}
	        ^
	       / \
	        |__ in order to compare, you must use the '==' and '!='
		    like in Java
	    This will just return true, because it sets x to 6--it doesn't 
	    compare anything
	  
	  if (x = 0) {...}
	    This will just return false, because it sets x to 0
