Aim: Variables are the spice of life

Do Now: What is the smallest variable type that could be used to store the
   	following values (using standard sizes).
	1) 5
	   + byte
	2) -30,000
	   + short
	3) 255
	   + short
	4) 5,000,000,000
	   + long
	  
	  - byte:  8 bits; from (-2)^7 to (2^7)--1 [-128 to 127]
	  - short: 16 bits; from (-2)^14 to (2^15)--1 
	  - int: 32 bits; from (-2)^31 to (2^31)--1 [-2 billion to 2 billion]
	  - long: 64 bits; from (-2)^63 to (2^31)--1 [-9 billion to 9 billion]


C Primitive Variable Types

    - All C primitives are numeric
    - The only difference is floating point vs. integer and the size of the 
      variable
